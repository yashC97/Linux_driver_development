# Linux_driver_development

My repostory of the basic linux driver codes that I had written/ am writing in the course of my learning 
of linux kernel's working and driver development 

There is only one master in it and it is empty.
  all the driver codes are branches of that master and if two drivers are related, or one is an advanced verson of the 
  other, then the advance one is branch of the basic one.
